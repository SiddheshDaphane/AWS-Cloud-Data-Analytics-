# AWS-Cloud-Data-Analytics

## INTRODUCTION
The Chancellor's Office at Major University has embarked on a strategic initiative to
modernize its data and analytics capabilities. As enrollments spike in new online programs,
the limitations of current infrastructure are being exposed. Legacy systems, siloed data, and
rising costs threaten the University's ability to provide robust services that drive student
success.
A cross-functional team has been tasked with designing a unified, cloud-based platform to
consolidate the existing hybrid environment. This new architecture aims to enable
advanced analytics, improve data governance, reduce expenses, and scale to accommodate
rapid growth.

## Problem Background
Over the last decade, Major University has added a multitude of new systems as on-campus
and online courses expanded. With thousands of additional students and hundreds of
cohorts, managing the accompanying data has become an pressing challenge.
The current environment relies on dated solutions that create data silos and drive
complexity. A mix of on-premise and cloud databases power vendor and custom
applications, resulting in fractured views of information. As duplicative systems proliferate,
costs and data discrepancies balloon.
The outdated infrastructure hamstrings administratorsâ€™ ability to quickly deploy new
capabilities or generate insights through modern techniques like machine learning. Lacking
standardization and a "single source of truth" puts institutional analytics and reporting at
risk.
